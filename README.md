## Setup
This Bot is not being actively hosted. You may clone and use/host the Bot and its features for yourself. It is built to be deployed locally and not cloud based but can be easily edited to do so.

Currently the YouTube music feature is down do to Discords recent ban on music functionality for Discord Bots.
